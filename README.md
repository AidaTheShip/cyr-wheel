# Reinforcement Learning 
We will use Mujuco to model the dynamics of the wheel in python. Then we use stable baselines to provide and set up a stable reinforcement learning algorithm. 

## Mujuco
Mujuco uses XML files. What are XML files? 
XML files lets you define and store data in a shareable manner. It provides rules to define any data. It cannot perform its own computing operations but it can be implemented for structured data managemnet.
